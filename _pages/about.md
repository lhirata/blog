Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm Lauren Hirata Singh, a technical writer at [Cockroach Labs](https://cockroachlabs.com). I live in Brooklyn, NY and when I'm not busy documenting [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs), I'm doing dog things with [my dog](https://instagram.com/peteecanhearyou) or learning how to bake bread.
