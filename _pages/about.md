Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm Lauren Hirata, a technical writer at [Cockroach Labs](https://cockroachlabs.com). I live in Brooklyn, NY and when I'm not busy documenting [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs), I'm doing dog things with [my dog](https://instagram.com/peteecanhearyou), practicing calligraphy, or trying to find fun activities "post-retirement" from basketball (shoulder injury).

I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) with a B.A. in [Creative Writing and Professional Writing](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/undergraduate/index.html). My career is a little unique, since my only professional experience is in technical writing-- a lot of people find their way into tech writing after stints in other fields. While I never dreamt of "being a technical writer" when I was a kid, I'm really enjoying my journey so far. I hope my insights help you, whether you're trying to break into the industry or are a veteran writer.

Feel free to reach out-- I'd love to hear about your experiences, what questions you have for me, or just make a connection!
