# Hello, world!

I'm finally kicking off this blog. I need a project that encourages me to write for fun, so I can practice flexing that muscle.

This will be a messy, un-curated blog. I'm too lazy to have a "brand", so I'm expecting posts range in topics, like[<sup>1</sup>](#footnotes):

- Technical writing
- Bread making
- Signs on the street (I like)
- My dog, fostering dogs, rescue, etc.
- TBD

So here we are folks: welcome to my blog. Hope you find something entertaining and/or informational in my future posts!
