Most kids don't grow up with career goals of being a technical writer. I didn't. When I was a kid, I wanted to grow up to be a professional basketball player, a dentist, or an astronaut. Since none of those professions seem related in the least sense, how did I get to this moment in time? To being a technical writer?

Happy accidents. A dream of playing college basketball got me to a small Division III school I had never heard of, being from California: Carnegie Mellon University. During my freshman year, I declared my majors: Creative Writing and Professional Writing. English was always my best subject growing up, and were the subjects that my favorite teachers taught.

When I declared Creative Writing, my parents told me I needed to also double major in Professional Writing (Technical Writing without the extensive science and math courses), so I could get a job upon graduation. Of course, I scoffed, but I followed their instruction.

School was great, but the job fairs were terrible. CMU did a really great job of setting up different "tech" job fairs but they were all generalized and aimed at engineers. Nobody seemed to know what to do with a girl with an English degree.

Fast forward to about a decade later and here I am! I've been a technical writer since I graduated college, and I've learned a lot along the way. That's where this blog comes in. The goal for this blog is to share my experiences as a technical writer, to hopefully help someone in some way. The other goal of this blog is just for me to _write_. I haven't written "for fun" in a long time, so I'll be writing about whatever I can (e.g., baking bread, dogs, signs on the street that I like). You've been warned.

So here we are folks: welcome to my blog. Hope you find something entertaining and/or informational in my future posts!
